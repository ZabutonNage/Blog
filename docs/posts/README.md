# The Blog Section

::: tip New article!
At last! The first article has been published. It talks about implementing **optional chaining** with plain JavaScript. It gets beefed up with default values and safe function application through monadic structures for an extra smooth developer experience. â†’ [SafeAccess](/posts/2019/SafeAccess.html)

The blog section is exactly what it sounds like. Find published posts in the left navigation. Entries are sorted latest to oldest.

Or take the shortcut: [SafeAccess](/posts/2019/SafeAccess.html).

## Some random resources

Here is a list of resources that I find relevant to share. They also give some clues of what you can expect from this blog.

### JavaScript doesn't need class syntax

Class syntax was basically introduced because of **familiarity bias**. Which is quite a terrible reason to make something part of the standard. Remember, once it's in, it will NEVER be removed again. Don't make the language adjust to you. Get familiar with the language you choose to use. Nobody would consider introducing dynamic types to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) just because JavaScript developers are used to them and want to use Haskell now. Or maybe introduce JavaScript's [double-equals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality) to Java, anyone?

### Composing Software by Eric Elliott

A series by [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott) which I enjoyed reading very much. Highly recommended to **everybody** getting involved with JavaScript.  
It shows very nicely that JS pretty much already has everything it needs to write brilliant software. It also touches on topics like functors and monads. Again, highly recommended to read all episodes.

### A second thought on async/await

After all they are not as cool as one might think. They obfuscate the flow of execution and are basically [syntactic salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar#Syntactic_salt).
