# The Blog Section

<expiring-div start="2019-03-11" :days="14">
::: tip New article!
At last! The first article has been published. It talks about implementing **optional chaining** with plain JavaScript. It gets beefed up with default values and safe function application through monadic structures for an extra smooth developer experience. â†’ [SafeAccess](/posts/2019/SafeAccess.html)

The blog section is exactly what it sounds like. Find published posts in the left navigation. Entries are sorted latest to oldest.

Or take the shortcut: [SafeAccess](/posts/2019/SafeAccess.html).

## Some random resources

Here is a list of resources that I find relevant to share. They also give some clues of what you can expect from this blog.

### Composing Software by Eric Elliott

[https://leanpub.com/composingsoftware](https://leanpub.com/composingsoftware)

One of my favourites. It's a refreshingly modern approach to JavaScript that shows very nicely that JS pretty much already has everything it needs to write brilliant software. It also does a great job in explaining things like functors and monads.

Highly recommended to **everybody** involved with JavaScript.

Also available as a blog series.

Eric Elliott also [tweets about it](https://twitter.com/_ericelliott) on Twitter.

### JavaScript doesn't need class syntax

Class syntax was basically introduced because of **familiarity bias**. Which is quite a terrible reason to make something part of the standard. Remember, once it's in, it will NEVER be removed again. Don't make the language adjust to you. Get familiar with the language you choose to use. Nobody would consider introducing dynamic types to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) just because JavaScript developers are used to them and want to use Haskell now. Or maybe introduce JavaScript's [double-equals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality) to Java, anyone?
