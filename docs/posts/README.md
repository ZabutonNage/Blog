## Some random resources

For the time being here is a list of resources that I find relevant to share. They also give some clues of what you can expect from this blog.

### JavaScript doesn't need classes

If you don't understand JavaScript, learn it properly. Don't make the language adjust to you. Nobody would consider introducing dynamic types to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) just because JavaScript developers are used to them and want to use Haskell now. Or maybe introduce JavaScript's [double-equals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality) to Java, anyone?

### Composing Software by Eric Elliott

A series by [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott) which I enjoyed reading very much. Highly recommended to **everybody** getting involved with JavaScript.  
It shows very nicely that JS pretty much already has everything it needs to write brilliant software. It also touches on topics like functors and monads. Again, highly recommended to read all episodes.

### A second thought on async/await

After all they are not as cool as one might think. They obfuscate the flow of execution and are basically [syntactic salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar#Syntactic_salt).

### Angular and React are obsolete

A small rant on front-end frameworks and why [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is the best choice.  
Pretty much reflects my personal experience.

This article is just to get the ball rolling. There is much more material on this topic. You might want to check out a recent tutorial on Vue.js.

From React developers I often hear they don't like Vue's custom HTML attributes in its templates. That's cosmetics! Cosmetic reasons are cited when there are no real reasons. While talking about cosmetics and React's JSX syntax....mixing HTML and JavaScript? Now _THAT_ is fugly.
